/**
 * Fresh Editor TypeScript Plugin API
 *
 * This file provides type definitions for the Fresh editor's TypeScript plugin system.
 * Plugins have access to the global `editor` object which provides methods to:
 * - Query editor state (buffers, cursors, viewports)
 * - Modify buffer content (insert, delete text)
 * - Add visual decorations (overlays, highlighting)
 * - Interact with the editor UI (status messages, prompts)
 *
 * Note: types/fresh.d.ts is auto-generated from this template and src/ts_runtime.rs
 *
 * ## Core Concepts
 *
 * ### Buffers
 * A buffer holds text content and may or may not be associated with a file.
 * Each buffer has a unique numeric ID that persists for the editor session.
 * Buffers track their content, modification state, cursor positions, and path.
 * All text operations (insert, delete, read) use byte offsets, not character indices.
 *
 * ### Splits
 * A split is a viewport pane that displays a buffer. The editor can have multiple
 * splits arranged in a tree layout. Each split shows exactly one buffer, but the
 * same buffer can be displayed in multiple splits. Use split IDs to control which
 * pane displays which buffer.
 *
 * ### Virtual Buffers
 * Special buffers created by plugins to display structured data like search results,
 * diagnostics, or git logs. Virtual buffers support text properties (metadata attached
 * to text ranges) that plugins can query when the user selects a line. Unlike normal
 * buffers, virtual buffers are typically read-only and not backed by files.
 *
 * ### Text Properties
 * Metadata attached to text ranges in virtual buffers. Each entry has text content
 * and a properties object with arbitrary key-value pairs. Use `getTextPropertiesAtCursor`
 * to retrieve properties at the cursor position (e.g., to get file/line info for "go to").
 *
 * ### Overlays
 * Visual decorations applied to buffer text without modifying content. Overlays can
 * change text color and add underlines. Use overlay IDs to manage them; prefix IDs
 * enable batch removal (e.g., "lint:" prefix for all linter highlights).
 *
 * ### Modes
 * Keybinding contexts that determine how keypresses are interpreted. Each buffer has
 * a mode (e.g., "normal", "insert", "special"). Custom modes can inherit from parents
 * and define buffer-local keybindings. Virtual buffers typically use custom modes.
